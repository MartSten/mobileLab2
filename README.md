lab 2 for mobile dev at NTNU

The code is based on this tutorial: 

The app fetches and pares an RSS feed, provided by the user in the form of an url, and lists the items in a recyclerview.
If the user clicks on any of the items in the recyclerview, a new activity with a webview opens and loads the page.
The user can also at any point change the RSS url and the number of items shown in the recyclerview. (The user can also set the rate of how often the app should pull updates, however this not implemented jet (as it was not listed in the requierments))
